.SH NAME
printf
.SH SYNOPSIS
Simplified version of printf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions in the printf() family produce output according to a format as described below. The functions printf() and vprintf() write output to stdout, the standard output stream; fprintf() and vfprintf() write output to the given output stream; sprintf(), snprintf(), vsprintf() and vsnprintf() write to the character string str.

The functions snprintf() and vsnprintf() write at most size bytes (including the terminating null byte ('\0')) to str.
.SH OPTIONS
No options.
.SH SEE ALSO

.SH BUGS
Because sprintf() and vsprintf() assume an arbitrarily long string, callers must be careful not to overflow the actual space; this is often impossible to assure. Note that the length of the strings produced is locale-dependent and difficult to predict.

.B Also, see Betty.
